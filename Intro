# Flask Framework: 1. Flask is a lightweight WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) web application micro-framework
# 2. It is useful for creating the web applications in python.

# Here we will learn about flask framework and will create an application and deploy it on the heroku


# pip install virtualenv
# virtualenv env

# We are creating a virtual environment ( a copy of the original python), which
# means that we are isolated the environment so that it does not affect the base
# environment


# Once your environment is successfully created, you need to activate it.
# type command:   .\env\Scripts\activate.ps1  (ps1 means under powershell)

# sometimes the scripts under env will not execute in that case just
# run this command :  Set ExecutionPolicy unrestricted




** Flask Framework Installation **

# Now, finally install flask framework:
# pip install flask.

# The app.py , static and templates must be outside of the env but needs to be in same folder
# where isolated new env is there.




** BOOTSTRAP **
# We will make use of BOOTSTRAP to make the templates as more beautiful and relevant
# getbootstrap.com starter Page

# Bootstrap has container and container fluid classes which helps you to align the items
# inside of a container  also bootstrap has a class my-3 which means you can give margin
# from top to down(y-axis) with a size



** Flask SQLALCHEMY **
# For creating the databases with flask we will actually use the flask sqlalchemy
# just install it using command pip install flask-sqlalchemy

# SQLALCHEMY is a orm mapper which allows you to make changes with databases
and facilitates the work through python.


# Jinja2 template
pip install Jinja2


# TEMPLATE INHERITANCE:
# This concept is used if you want to have like in navbar on some page you have about and you want
# to change in 10 templates as about us you can do it manually but that is time consuming
# so you can use template inheritance and define navbar at one template and then you can change in other
# templates.



# Gunicorn
# To serve our application in multiple threads for that we use the gunicorn.

Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) is a widely used Python WSGI HTTP server essential for deploying Flask applications
in production environments. Flask's built-in server is only suitable for development and testing, not for
production-level traffic.

To use Gunicorn with a Flask application using a Procfile, you typically define a command in your
Procfile that tells Gunicorn how to run your app.

# pip install gunicorn
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
# here the requirements.txt file will automatically created and will contain all the things
# that are required to run our application
